Dependencies:

- Before you use that program you have to install the following 
	
	- RATT/Mummer
	- Biopython
	- also update your Perl version ;-)

Explained in the following:
Note: The install-Scripts are only there for orientation! Open them and modify them to your needs (e.g. location for bin's etc)


#############################

INSTALL RATT/Mummer

0) if you want to change the folder for installation then open bash-Skript and change $path-Variable (default: $HOME/bin)

1)>bash install_RATT.sh

2) Re-log to the server

3*) You can use the program now; see : http://ratt.sourceforge.net/documentation.html#How_to_call_the_program

4*) Instead of '$RATT_HOME/start.ratt.sh' you can use 'ratt'

UNINSTALL
1) cd $HOME/bin/mummer;make uninstall;
2) Folder in $HOME/bin was created, delete if if not present before (or delete RATT and mummer-folder)
3) in $HOME/.bashrc several Paths were set up, delete segment marked with the followig
		
	##RAST/MUMMER
	[...]
	##RAST/MUMMER


###########################

INSTALL Biopython  *Adapted to server environment

0) If you have admin rights (e.g. locally) try installing biopython with pip, so you won't need the other steps>
	python -m pip install --upgrade pip //or install
	pip install biopython
	//to check installation try import Bio in the python console
0) Install a seperate Python 2.7.* (since you don't have admin-rights on the Server)
1) Install numpy if not present (usually should)
2) mkdir $wherePythonInstalled/site-packages (e.g. $HOME/bin/Python2.7.3/site-packages)
3) python2 -m pip install --target=$wherePythonInstalled/site-packages biopython
4) add the following to your .bashrc: 
	export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$wherePythonInstalled"
5*)For using the programm also use that python installation: You can also save a alias like that for your .bashrc
	e.g. alias pp='$HOME/bin/Python-2.7.8/python'
6*)Check if Biopython was successfully installed by entering the python-shell (no errors should occur):
	>>>import Bio
7*)If you have problems here, there is many tutorials how to compile biopython. But Installation over pip is probably the fastest way. You  can also ask the Server-Admin to install the Biopython-libs
